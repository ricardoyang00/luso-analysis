# üíß LUSO ANALYSIS
### Water Supply Network Management System

> DA 2023/24 - Project 01, Group G07_9

This project provides a comprehensive management system for water supply networks in Portugal.

## üìä Problem Data
Utilizing an idealized [dataset](large-dataSet/) representing the Portuguese continental water supply network, 
the system employs a directed graph structure to model various network elements such as water `reservoirs`, 
`pumping stations`, and delivery sites `cities`. The user interacts with the system through a menu-driven interface, 
facilitating easy access to network analysis tools and operations.

## üöÄ Problem Motivation

### Basic Service Metrics
- **Determine Maximum Water Reach**: Calculate the maximum water flow to each `city` using the Edmonds-Karp algorithm.
- **Verify Network Configuration**: Assess if the existing configuration can meet all customer water needs and identify areas with deficits.
- **Load Balancing**: Develop algorithms to balance the load across the network, minimizing flow discrepancies.

### Reliability and Sensitivity to Failures
- **Reservoir Outage Impact**: Evaluate the effect of reservoir outages on delivery capacity and identify affected cities.
- **Pumping Station Maintenance**: Analyze the impact of pumping station maintenance on delivery capacity and identify affected cities.
- **Pipeline Failure Analysis**: Determine the impact of pipeline failures on water delivery to cities and identify affected areas.
